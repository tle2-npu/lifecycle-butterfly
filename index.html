    <h1>Metamorphosis</h1>
    <p>Metamorphosis is a Greek word that means transformation or change in shape</p>
    <p>Insects have two common types of metamorphosis:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grasshoppers, crickets, dragonflies, and cockroaches have incomplete metamorphosis</li>
      <p>The young (called a nymph) usually look like small adults but without the wings</p>
      <li>Butterflies, moths, beetles, flies and bees have complete metamorphosis</li>
      <p>The young (called a larva instead of a nymph) is very different from the adults. It also usually eats different types of food</p>
    </ul>
